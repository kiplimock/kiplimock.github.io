# kiplimock.github.io
Source code for my personal website <a href="https://kiplimock.github.io" target="_blank">https://kiplimock.github.io</a>.

I built this using Yaoyao Liu's <a href="https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/minimal-light" target="_blank">minimal light</a> theme which I found to be really cool while maintaining a very academic feel. Check it out. His code is primarily built on Ruby and Jekyll but I preferred use the good old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Makes my work easy.
